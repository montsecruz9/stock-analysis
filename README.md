  ###Execution times for refactored code
 As our refactored code had some malfunctions, we couldn't run the script. We don't have the execution times. 

## Summary
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring code means to improve the structure of the code in order to make it easier to handle, reuse and fix errors for software developers. It makes the code more efficient and easy to read. On the other hand, while refactoring, it is so easy to be imprecise while handling our code. This can introduce new errors into our code that we will need to fix.

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The refactored code was smaller and looked so easy to read but new errors and bugs appeared. It was hard to come to a solution, but I bet it was just one single variable that needed to be taken care of.
